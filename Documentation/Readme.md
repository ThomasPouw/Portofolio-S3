## Research Paper
Here we have my first research paper on Colour Psychology. When it started it was about Colour Theory, but when somebody pointed out that my survey was more about colour psychology and not really colour theory, I decided to change it.
But it did surprise me with how much colour affects people mentally. 
Of course, there is the expected dark colours bring negative emotions and bright colours bring positive emotions. 
But there are some fun exceptions. Like Crimson and Red. If you look at Crimson, a colour based on red and blue, you would think it would bring negative emotions.
As Crimson is part of the dark colours… But it is the opposite. It brings the positive emotions with it. The feeling of love and passion. But also, blood.
While Red is more seen as danger and anger. The more negative aspect of the core colour.  
So, you can see that you cannot really judge the colours by its hue’s.
In the spreadsheet the colours will be named under the results. 
As I did not know that google forms made the results into spreadsheets. 
And I did not want to say the colours as the colour name can give people the first word for free. Colours like aqua. 

The other research was a more simpeler one. As it was research on Roles and Permissions in java. Sadly the new found knowledge got unused this semester because of time restrainse. now i atleast know what to do when i use everything exept single page application. As to access Roles and permissions you need the managment key, which you can not get with just a SPA. you need a web application for that. And sadly i found out to late to change it.

## Project Plan
Here we have my project plan. 
The original plan and so is not updated yet with my current idea. 
As some things have changed as I will not be using Bump.js anymore as the Typescript version of that library is a bit broken. 
But instead, just using the borders of the sprite to look for collision. 
And for the End and Cargo Sprites it uses that same system, but then also two extra checks if they are the right type of block and if they match precisely. 
As maybe in the future there will be multiple cargo and end sprites. Its just to future proof it. Nothing more.
