## Web Application


## Agile Method
We use the Scrum method, where Nour is the Scrum master and I keep the time. As i found that keeping time was not this groups strong suit. 
Now it is alot better, but even then i have to ask people where they are. And if they can be on location under 15 minutes.

## Cultural differences and ethics
For cutural differences and etics, i do everything i can to not offend anyone without losing my dutch ways. So i will be direct, but i wont be rude in that directness. 
Ofcourse there are still blunders like arguing that an hour travel is way to much with people from Syria and Turkey. 
But even then i will appoligize when i see the point they were actually making. And how my point of view was 100% dutch and so was biased.

## Requirements and Design

## Business Processes

## Professional
If i get stuck and if i can not find the information online then i ask Tycho for help, the reason being is that Tycho is the more realible backend developer. 
And even then i will try to find the answer myself. You wont see me being rude for no reason, i am only rude when i have to be rude, as i just do not like to talk somebody down. 

For knowledge, i constantly ask people if they need help or any tips.
