To be honest, i think i did pretty good this semester. Of course i could done way better. 
But from a mental health perspective i fdid gret. As there were no really big stress moments in this semester. 
Ofcourse these last few weeks were a bit stressful, but that is natural. 

When it comes to what i did. I am proud as i learned how typescrypt and angular work and how you can really use those two together. 
I learned how to actually work with Java as i do not know what i did last semester with it, but coding was not one of them.
And overall i learned to be more sure of myself and  not always be in the "self hate" corner. Maybe self hate is a strong word, it was more in the "Is this good?= no" category.
But thanks to study coaching, the study psycholoog and the book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* ck" by Mark Manson I learned how to just not give a shit about what people think of me and how my actions can somehow influence there perspective of me.
Because that wa what it all was. My brain seeing 100 possibilities and being sad because it thought of 1000 negative once.

Ofcourse there are parts to improve. As that same brain still makes a few of those senarios and so makes it hard to really ask for feedback and during 1 on 1 talks make it so that i can not really talk. 
As i will see the things that i did wrong instead off talking to the other. ANd then there is the things i could not do this semester, things like Worlds, a leveleditor and "Roles and Permissions"
What i mean by the third one is any security that isnt just the single page application from auth0.
