# Portofolio-S3 Thomas Pouw

In this Git Repository you will find my project how it is at this moment in time. You can see it as a time capsule. 
Ofcourse i am gonna talk about my project, documents and learning outcomes.

## Documentation
In this Folder you will find the Project Plan and the Research folder. Within the research folder you will find the paper on Colour Psychology and the spreadsheet with the results of my survey.

## Project
In the Project Folder you will find the full project with everything attached. So be careful with when you download this repository. Ofcourse i will tsalk a bit more about my project in that folders README.

## Learning Outcomes

This Folder will be split into 2. As The GP and IP have differents outcomes. Ofcourse ome are the same, but even then they are different in execution. I can be good in GP and Bad in IP. ANd so i will be writing them both in full.
