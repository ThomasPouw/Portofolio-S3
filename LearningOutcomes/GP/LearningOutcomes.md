## Web Application
At the project I am more the person working on the backend, I am doing that because I wanted to see how ASP.net worked for myself and as I was using SpringBoot for my IP it just made sense for me. The code I make is based on the coding rules of C# and how Tycho writes his part of the code. As it is easier for me to change my coding style then Tycho as he was already familiar with ASP.net and I still needed to know how to do the backend in C#. 
For now, I am working on testing, but that is more because testing just started last sprint and so not all tests were made yet and I had to look at it for a few days.

## Agile Method
We use the Scrum method, where Nour is the Scrum master and I keep the time. As I found that keeping time was not this groups strong suit. 
Now it is a lot better, but even then, I have to ask people where they are. And if they can be on location under 15 minutes. 
Every Group project day we do a standup and while we said we also would do standdowns. It just does not happen all the time as people sometimes haveto leave early and then somebody else also leaves. And a standdown with half your team missing is not the greatest.

## Cultural differences and ethics
For cultural differences and ethics, I do everything I can to not offend anyone without losing my Dutch ways. So, I will be direct, but I will not be rude in that directness. 
Of course, there are still blunders like arguing that an hour travel is way too much with people from Syria and Turkey. 
But even then, I will apologize when I see the point they were making. And how my point of view was 100% Dutch and so was biased.

## Requirements and Design
During the meetings with the team, I give some ideas on how things could be done and usually I take no as an answer. Of course, there are exceptions, but that is more when I truly believe it to be the right idea for the problem. 
For testing I started to test the backend without obligation, as I saw that the backend did not have enough tasks for that sprint for 3 people. So, I asked the group if I could start testing and while waiting, I started on the testing plan for the backend. If they would have said no I would of argued with them about how important testing is and how it is notthe best practice to delay testing any longer.

## Business Processes
While I am not the best at talking, the explaining of business processes is going oke. But that is more because of me second guessing myself every time I talk. But I am getting help for that, or at least the main problem of "What do other people think of me". But when you see me talking with confidents you see that I know my stuff. And I will tell it to you as good as I can as slow as I can. So, if something can better be said in 500 words, I will use those 500 words and I will not shorten it to 100. I know how important it is to take things slowly and how easy language is more important than being fancy. 

In the Group voice calls it goes the same. Only with a few more bad jokes. But I appreciate everybody's contribution and will not interrupt them when they are speaking. As I know how annoying it is when somebody interrupts you as you will lose your train of thought. Of course, this also applies to the client meetings. 

But I can see how I should talk more in the client meetings as I am mute in those right now.

## Professional
If I get stuck and if I cannot find the information online then I ask Tycho for help, the reason being is that Tycho is the more reliable backend developer. 
And even then, I will try to find the answer myself. You will not see me being rude for no reason, I am only rude when I have to be rude, as I just do not like to talk somebody down. 

For knowledge, I constantly ask people if they need help or any tips.
