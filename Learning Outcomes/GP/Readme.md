# GP

## Web Application
At the project I am more the person working on the backend, I am doing that because I wanted to see how ASP.net worked for myself and as I was using SpringBoot for my IP it just made sense for me. The code I make is based on the coding rules of C# and how Tycho writes his part of the code. As it is easier for me to change my coding style then Tycho as he was already familiar with ASP.net and I still needed to know how to do the backend in C#. 
The Backend testing is as complete as was necessary for this semester. Of course, in later semesters I should really investigate all the test methods. and not just unit testing. But you cannot really do anything else in the backend. As it was just a highway to the database.

## Agile Method
We use the Scrum method, where Nour is the Scrum master and I keep the time. As I found that keeping time was not this groups strong suit. 
Now it is a lot better, but even then, I must ask people where they are. And if they can be on location under 15 minutes. 
Every Group project day we try to do a stand-up and while we said we also would do standdowns. It just does not happen all the time as people sometimes have to leave early and then somebody else also leaves. And a standdown with half your team missing is not the greatest.
Sadly, I have to say that we kind of failed in this sense, as it did not really become better. As we could not really control certain people's bad alarm schedules.
Sadly, we did not really do more with the agile methods, but at least I tried to put that topic whenever it was possible and nothing else important as talked about. 
But I think the final nail in the coffin was the fact that we just needed to know about it and so you did not really need to do it. 

But of course, like I said we did have a scrum master, even though it never changed, and it was a scrum master in name alone. What we did have is a sprint planning that was maybe a bit unbalanced. As I as part of the back-end team sometimes had to make up tasks to keep me busy. That is how things like try-catch and backend testing started. As a way for me to do something. 

But I do know things about scrum because of last semester where my group and I researched agile methods together. There we learned about the "Agile Project Management" and its core principles of "Transparency", "Customer Focus", "Adaptability", "Sense of Ownership" and "Continuous Improvement". What it boils down to is that this system is made to lower downtime and increase customer satisfaction. By making it so that the customer and the programming team has constant contact and a easy way to give and receive new or updated ideas/feedback.

There is also the DSDM system that focuses more on dividing roles. With the "Visionary" being the person in the team that gives high priority to certain things and lower to others. He/she is the planner of the group. 
The "Project Manager" that just controls the overall project.
The "Team Leader" that is responsible for coordination and facilitating collaboration. 
The "Solution Developer", The one who looks at the requirements and mainly prototypes and code the programs
And finally, the "Solution Tester", who sole purpose is to test the product and give feedback on what to improve and change. He/she does that by writing tests and when the Solution Developer changes anything the Tester has to redo their tests.
This is not the full list of roles that DSDM implements as there are 13 roles in [DSDM](https://www.agilebusiness.org/page/ProjectFramework_07_RolesResponsibilities).

## Cultural differences and ethics
For cultural differences and ethics, I do everything I can to not offend anyone without losing my Dutch ways. So, I will be direct, but I will not be rude in that directness. 
Of course, there are still blunders like arguing that an hour travel is way too much with people from Syria and Turkey. 
But even then, I will apologize when I see the point they were making. And how my point of view was 100% Dutch and so was biased.
But knowing cultural and religious differences is also important. If you know somebody is for example Muslim, you do not offer him cookies during Ramadan or offer them a meat dish that is not Hallel or offer an Indians anything beef. You do not do that because Cows are sacred in India. And you should respect the cultures of others. Even when some ideals are completely the opposite from yourself.

When I meet new people for the first time or just got a job you will see that I slowly start testing the waters of what is allowed and what not. I do that by very light jokes (jokes that are not racist, sexist, religious or any other things that can have a negative effect.). I will also try to learn how much of the internet they know as some jokes only make sense when you know the internet. Jokes like how France, Ohio and Australia do not exist. I will only joke about that when i know the person will get it. 

When it comes to authority in companies, it is a bit weird. As I do a kind of a hybrid system of the two sides of hierarchy. As I respect the people higher them me, but I still sometimes ask them for a casual chat. Of course, even in a casual chat I will be respectful to the other person if they care a lot about hierarchy. Of course, if I know that a person is from a country like Japan where hierarchy is everything, I will not make a casual conversation with the person. As it will just confuse/anger them more than the conversation is worth. What i mean by this whole paragraph is that I take an around 50/50 approach when it is about people's cultures. As I find person preferences a bit more important. As not everybody really fits the cultural normal, and sometimes they even work better outside of the cultural jail they created for themselves because they had to act a certain way. I am not saying everybody is trapped. Just that some are. Of course, Hierarchy is not the only way that cultures differ as concepts of individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, long term orientation vs short-term orientation and indulgence vs restraints also exist as a source of the [memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) 

As an example of two of the points in more feminine cultures both males and females are more emotion driven and both have the same load when it comes with dealing with their family. While more masculine cultures have it so that the female has the load of the family, while the male is not very concerned what happens with their family. At least when it goes right, when something goes wrong, he will look at that situation like it is a fact. With less emotions that the feminine male counterpart.
For countries to compare see countries like Japan vs The Netherlands. Japan scores a 95 in Masculinity while The Netherlands scores a 14. You can see that different immediately. As for example when a dad hears that his son or daughter did bad at school. The Dutch father tries to calm there child down and maybe even helps them. While Japanese fathers are sterner and see any fail as a real failure. And it just means that that child did not learn enough. Of course, this is just an example. In every community its different. And there is a reason why the scale is from 1 to 120. So even if Japan is number 1 in the world in Masculinity it does not mean that all parents are like this. Just a lot of them and even the parents that are not like this all the time have traits of this. Same with the Netherlands but then reversed. 

For the long-term orientation vs short-term orientation, I can talk about the almost poster child of long-term orientation: China and its very fast rise as a superpower. As their whole plan was almost planned to detail. With everybody wanting to succeed in life for the long term. So, if they buy anything be it building or stocks. If it can be a success in the long-term, they will do it. They do not really care about the short term. Or at least not as much as other countries would.

And when it comes to ethics it is a bit more difficult. As ethics comes down to morals. For example: What is the line for attracting people to your product? 
Is it spamming ad campaigns? Is it making your game addictive or just making a good game first? My answer would be the first one as even spam ads is already bad, but at least it is not as bad as the others. As the first one would detract customers and the second one would get you maybe even banned from certain countries. As one way to make game addictive is loot boxes. And a lot of countries count that as gambling as you could use real world money to buy loot boxes. For that reason, games like Super Mario Run and Mario Kart Tour are banned in countries like Belgium. I am saying it because like I said ethics is a weird concept. As it boils down to "Do not make a product to addicting and flashy". 
But of course, ethics is not just about addiction prevention. But also, things like security and privacy. As is it ethical to know everything about your customers without them knowing? or even if you ask them, how much do you really need to know about them? And can you sell that information to others with or without their permission? I would say not. I would like to know the bare minimum about somebody else, and even that I would not sell to another company. And even the bare minimum I would warn the customer about, outside of the terms and service. As no one reads those and even are made so long so that people do not knows what they agree too.

When it came to ethics in the group project, it was quite simple as there was not really way to make bad ethics possible. As the website is meant as a bland slate. So, no pop-up ads or spam was possible, no clickbait colour choices. No other impulsive behaviour that we could exploit. Not that we would have, at least I would have complained until it was removed, the others probably too. I am not saying that Mediaan would do this either. Just when you are speaking about ethics you need to look at the ugly side of your work. Because if you do not do that you will be like EA with there [surprise mechanics](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/21/18691760/ea-vp-loot-boxes-surprise-mechanics-ethical-enjoyable) or Blizzard's [assault/harassment charges](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit). But of course, these two examples are in a different section of ethics that I am talking about. But when you are talking ethics. You sometimes have to look at things like this.

Of course, there could have been a few things that would improve ethics in the project like a better warning system for allergens. But because of time restrains it sadly had to be cut. The reason why i put this in ethics is because of the notion of preventing harm because of stupidity/not reading correctly. As many people will just not read things even if it is very important to do so. Things like the fine print in contracts or the terms and service. But that is whole other can of worms of bankrupt ethics in its own. As technically the reason why they are so long is to make people just agree with it and not read it. As even the bank does not do that. proven by this article [here](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/one-man-turned-tables-on-bank-and-got-best-credit-card-ever-18fb0b718855).
## Requirements and Design
Our stake holder for this project is a company called [Mediaan](https://mediaan.com/). It is an IT company originally just based in Heerlen. Now they also have offices in Düsseldorf, München, Hasselt and Brussels.

During the meetings with the team, I give some ideas on how things could be done and usually I take no as an answer. Of course, there are exceptions, but that is more when I truly believe it to be the right idea for the problem. 
For the groups project I did the CRUD of Ingredient, IngredientCategory and OrderItem and added Try catches to every API entry point in the project and after that I did around 90% of the testing of the backend. Of course, there are also things that got removed. Like the CRUD of Allergens. I tried to convince them that we really needed that and for a few weeks I did. But we decided to cut that idea. Even if I was not really for that cut myself as I worked and thought hard about it. 
But I get why it was cut as it would off meant that the frontend team had to implement some extra logic into checking if an menuitem had an allergen with it that was already warned about in the basket. Like I said I get it now, even though I may have been a bit unprofessional at the time talking about it. But that was also just a timing thing, as I was a bit irritated by the fact that some were way too late. Even though I made it very clear that coming to late again would have consequences. Even though I really meant consequences with the teacher and the coming late thing never improved I still think I overreacted a bit, just by the fact that I still felt disappointed a few hours later. 
For testing I started to test the backend without obligation, as I saw that the backend did not have enough tasks for that sprint for 3 people. So, I asked the group if I could start testing and while waiting, I started on the testing plan for the backend. If they would have said no, I would have argued with them about how important testing is and how it is not the best practice to delay testing any longer.

Early one we made designs in Figma, I started with the idea of how it should look like with help of Hisham and the others. Here is even the [link](https://www.figma.com/file/1AfJLb3fnfaxN8q6pbGCCg/Restaurant-Menu?node-id=0%3A1) to the program we used.

Of course, not all early designs made it in the final product. As most of them were made by Hisham and me. We were both part of the backend team. And we just gave the frontend team a design to work from. Of course, after we have them these designs, they looked also at similar program like Butlaro

From that they came to the design we have today. And they really did a great job if i have to say that myself.
## Business Processes
While I am not the best at talking, the explaining of business processes is going oke. But that is more because of me second guessing myself every time I talk. But I am getting help for that, or at least the main problem of "What do other people think of me". But when you see me talking with confidents you see that I know my stuff. And I will tell it to you as good as I can as slow as I can. So, if something can better be said in 500 words, I will use those 500 words and I will not shorten it to 100. I know how important it is to take things slowly and how easy language is more important than being fancy. 

In the Group voice calls it goes the same. Only with a few more bad jokes. But I appreciate everybody's contribution and will not interrupt them when they are speaking. As I know how annoying it is when somebody interrupts you as you will lose your train of thought. Of course, this also applies to the client meetings. 
But I can see how I should talk more in the client meetings as I am mute in those right now.
I should maybe hold a more active role in a group. As normally i am more of a support person. I know I can be more active as I did that in the past when the 'leaders' of a group were away for a few minutes. So, I know that I can do it, but my mind just stops me from doing that.

When it comes to the business relation to software applications, that is a good question. As it is indeed linked. As if there is good management in your group, then everybody is usually happier and more motivated. As their will be less chaos and constant questions about how things should be done. And I can see how this GP group maybe fell more into the chaotic side then the order side. And how that chaos was made by the lack of solid central leaders. As one of the 'leaders' was one of the people that was almost always late and i just could not lead during this semester. As I was way too focused on myself and my self-confidence problems. It probably also did not help that at least 50% of all meeting were online. And so, taking control of the situation is just harder in general.

## Professional
If I get stuck and if I cannot find the information online then I ask Tycho for help, the reason being is that Tycho is the more reliable backend developer. 
And even then, I will try to find the answer myself. You will not see me being rude for no reason, I am only rude when I have to be rude, as I just do not like to talk somebody down. 

For knowledge, I try asking people if they need help or any tips.

To be honest it is hard to say anything about professionalism as it is as much what you say as it is what you do not say. What I mean by this is somebody act professional but react very rudely for no reason. Does that mean he is professional? No, I do not think so, as to be Professional you need a certain composure. Something even I have sometimes trouble keeping. As my team was late a lot of the time. And I think the reason why I lost it sometimes was more because I was always so early. 
But being professional also means that you should know what the others are doing and what to say in certain situation and when to just stop talking.
What I mean by that is what happened with Hisham and the payment system. That was not planned so early and at the meeting that he said that he was working on it it was the first time I heard about it and maybe you saw that in my face as well. But I kept the little rage I had to myself and said something to him about it after the meeting.

For proof of my professionalism here are some screenshots and context:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90248008/174296297-fc4087a7-8c1d-4cf9-94aa-252cce4b1dec.png)

We just heard that we could show the products at the Mediaan's building. And my parents live there so I tried to arrange something so that the Nour and Borga did not have to travel for 2 hours and 30 minutes. In the end it did not happen as my parents were against it, but at least I offered a solution and gave them how the train journey will go and how long the walk is from the station to Welten. (The missing message just did not read well. So, to prevent confusion I deleted it)

The reason why it is hard for me to give proof that I am professional is because most of the things I said are not recorded or typed. And so, I have no real base to proof myself. And, being professional is more subjective than objective as being professional can mean different things by context, by culture and even by person. A thing can be professional in certain cultures but be unprofessional and maybe even rude in others. Maybe that is the Dutch in me talking. As for professionalism their needs to be a certain type of respect for others. As for example asking your boss if he wants some tea from the machine is can be seen as normal in The Netherlands. But if you do that in certain other cultures and you can almost pack your stuff when you start asking about the tea.

But if you think add research into professional. Then I think I am professional. As I did 2 research papers for the IP project and another one for GP. And at least one or two you can see as a DOT framework papers. As one of the IP research (Colour Psychology) was a Field Research as it included a survey and i analysed that survey with online sources. In that survey I did learn to keep the possibility of answers to a certain amount. As it became hard for me to see any relation between the answers and what the colour would mean. 
The GP project one was more in line of a Desk or Lab research paper. As I showed in the paper how exactly the backend testing is done and what every command does. I did this after working with it for a few weeks. So, you can see it as a kind of prototype. As if that testing software did not work i would off used another and probably talked about in the paper.
