# GP

## Web Application
At the project I am more the person working on the backend, I am doing that because I wanted to see how ASP.net worked for myself and as I was using SpringBoot for my IP it just made sense for me. The code I make is based on the coding rules of C# and how Tycho writes his part of the code. As it is easier for me to change my coding style then Tycho as he was already familiar with ASP.net and I still needed to know how to do the backend in C#. 
The Backend testing is as complete as was necessary for this semester. Of course, in later semesters I should really investigate all the test methods. and not just unit testing. But you cannot really do anything else in the backend. As it was just a highway to the database.

## Agile Method
We use the Scrum method, where Nour is the Scrum master and I keep the time. As I found that keeping time was not this groups strong suit. 
Now it is a lot better, but even then, I must ask people where they are. And if they can be on location under 15 minutes. 
Every Group project day we try to do a stand-up and while we said we also would do standdowns. It just does not happen all the time as people sometimes have to leave early and then somebody else also leaves. And a standdown with half your team missing is not the greatest.
Sadly, I have to say that we kind of failed in this sense, as it did not really become better. As we could not really control certain people's bad alarm schedules.
Sadly we did not really do more with the agile methods, but atleast i tried to put that topic when ever it was possible and nothing else important as talked about. 
But i think the final nail in the coffin was the fact that we just needed to know about it and so you did not really need to do it. 

But ofcourse like i said we did have a scrum master, even though it never changed and it was a scrum master in name alone. What we did have is a sprint planning that was maybe a bit unbalanced. As I as part of the back end team sometimes had to make up tasks to keep me busy. Thats how things like try-catch and backend testing started. As a way for me to do something. 

But i do know things about scrum because of last semester

## Cultural differences and ethics
For cultural differences and ethics, I do everything I can to not offend anyone without losing my Dutch ways. So, I will be direct, but I will not be rude in that directness. 
Of course, there are still blunders like arguing that an hour travel is way too much with people from Syria and Turkey. 
But even then, I will apologize when I see the point they were making. And how my point of view was 100% Dutch and so was biased.
But knowing cultural and religious differences is also important. If you know somebody is for example Muslim, you do not offer him cookies during Ramadan or offer them a meat dish that is not Hallel or offer an Indians anything beef. You do not do that because Cows are sacred in India. And you should respect the cultures of others. Even when some ideals are completely the opposite from yourself.

When I meet new people for the first time or just got a job you will see that I slowly start testing the waters of what is allowed and what not. I do that by very light jokes (jokes that are not racist, sexist, religious or any other things that can have a negative effect.). I will also try to learn how much of the internet they know as some jokes only make sense when you know the internet. Jokes like how France, Ohio and Australia do not exist. I will only joke about that when i know the person will get it. 

When it comes to authority in companies, it is a bit weird. As I do a kind of a hybrid system of the two sides of hierarchy. As I respect the people higher them me, but I still sometimes ask them for a casual chat. Of course, even in a casual chat I will be respectful to the other person if they care a lot about hierarchy. Of course, if I know that a person is from a country like Japan where hierarchy is everything, I will not make a casual conversation with the person. As it will just confuse/anger them more than the conversation is worth. What i mean by this whole paragraph is that I take an around 50/50 approach when it is about people's cultures. As i find person preferences a bit more important. As not everybody really fits the cultural normal, and sometimes they even work better outside of the cultural jail they created for themselves because they had to act a certain way. I am not saying everybody is trapped. Just that some are. 

And when it comes to ethics it is a bit more difficult. As ethics comes down to morals. For example: What is the line for attracting people to your product? 
Is it spamming ad campaigns? Is it making your game addictive or just making a good game first? My answer would be the first one as even spam ads is already bad, but at least it is not as bad as the others. As the first one would detract customers and the second one would get you maybe even banned from certain countries. As one way to make game addictive is loot boxes. And a lot of countries count that as gambling as you could use real world money to buy loot boxes. For that reason, games like Super Mario Run and Mario Kart Tour are banned in countries like Belgium. I am saying it because like I said ethics is a weird concept. As it boils down to "Do not make a product to addicting and flashy". 
But of course, ethics is not just about addiction prevention. But also, things like security and privacy. As is it ethical to know everything about your customers without them knowing? or even if you ask them, how much do you really need to know about them? And can you sell that information to others with or without their permission? I would say not. I would like to know the bare minimum about somebody else, and even that I would not sell to another company. And even the bare minimum I would warn the customer about, outside of the terms and service. As no one reads those and even are made so long so that people do not knows what they agree too.

When it came to ethics in the group project, it was quite simple as there was no really way to make bad ethics possible. As the website is meant as a bland slate. So no pop up ads or spam was possible, no clickbaity colour choices. No other impulsive behaiver that we could expliot. Not that we would have, atleast i would have complained until it was removed, the others probarbly too. I am not saying that Mediaan would do this either. Just when you are speaking about ethics you need to look at the ugly side of your work. Because if you do not do that you will be like EA with there [surprise mechanics](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/21/18691760/ea-vp-loot-boxes-surprise-mechanics-ethical-enjoyable) or Blizzard's [assualt/harresment charges](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit). But ofcourse these two examples are in a diffent section of ethics that i am talking about. But when you are talking ethics. You sometimes have to look at things like this.

ofcourse there could of been a few things that would improve ethics in the project like a better warning system for allergens. But because of time restrains it sadly had to be cut. The reason why i put this in ethics is because of the notion of preventing harm because of stupitity/not reading correctly. As many people will just not read things even if its very important to do so. Things like the fine print in contracts or the terms and service. But that is whole other can of worms of bankrupt ethics in its own. As technicly the reason why they are so long is to make people just agree with it and not read it. As even the bank does not do that. proven by this article [here](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/one-man-turned-tables-on-bank-and-got-best-credit-card-ever-18fb0b718855).
## Requirements and Design
Our stake holder for this project is a company called [Mediaan](https://mediaan.com/). It is an IT company originally just based in Heerlen. Now they also have offices in Düsseldorf, München, Hasselt and Brussels.

During the meetings with the team, I give some ideas on how things could be done and usually I take no as an answer. Of course, there are exceptions, but that is more when I truly believe it to be the right idea for the problem. 
For the groups project i did the CRUD of Ingredient, IngredientCategory and OrderItem and added Try catches to every api entrypoint in the project and after that i did around 90% of the testing of the backend. Ofcourse there are also things that got removed. Like the CRUD of Allergens. I tried to convince them that we really needed that and for a few weeks i actually did. But we desided to cut that idea. Even if i was not really for that cut myself as i worked and thought hard about it. 
But i get why it was cut as it would off meant that the frontend team had to implement some extra logic into checking if an menuitem had an allergen withit that was already warned about in the basket. Like i said i get it now, even though i may been a bit unprofessional at the time talking about it. But that was also just a timing thing, as i was a bit irritated by the fact that some were way to late. Even though i made it very clear that coming to late again would have concequences. Even though i really  meant concequences with the teacher and the coming late thing never improved i still think i over reacted a bit, just by the fact that i still felt disappointed a few hours later. 
For testing I started to test the backend without obligation, as I saw that the backend did not have enough tasks for that sprint for 3 people. So, I asked the group if I could start testing and while waiting, I started on the testing plan for the backend. If they would have said no I would of argued with them about how important testing is and how it is not the best practice to delay testing any longer.

## Business Processes
While I am not the best at talking, the explaining of business processes is going oke. But that is more because of me second guessing myself every time I talk. But I am getting help for that, or at least the main problem of "What do other people think of me". But when you see me talking with confidents you see that I know my stuff. And I will tell it to you as good as I can as slow as I can. So, if something can better be said in 500 words, I will use those 500 words and I will not shorten it to 100. I know how important it is to take things slowly and how easy language is more important than being fancy. 

In the Group voice calls it goes the same. Only with a few more bad jokes. But I appreciate everybody's contribution and will not interrupt them when they are speaking. As I know how annoying it is when somebody interrupts you as you will lose your train of thought. Of course, this also applies to the client meetings. 
But I can see how I should talk more in the client meetings as I am mute in those right now.
I should maybe hold a more active role in a group. As normally i am more of a support person. I know I can be more active as I did that in the past when the 'leaders' of a group were away for a few minutes. So, I know that I can do it, but my mind just stops me from doing that.

When it comes to the business relation to software applications, that is a good question. As it is indeed linked. As if there is good management in your group, then everybody is usually happier and more motivated. As their will be less chaos and constant questions about how things should be done. And i can see how this GP group maybe fell more into the chaotic side then the order side. And how that chaos was made by the lack of solid central leaders. As one of the 'leaders' was one of the people that was almost always late and i just could not lead during this semester. As I was way too focused on myself and my self-confidence problems. It probably also did not help that at least 50% of all meeting were online. And so, taking control of the situation is just harder in general.

## Professional
If I get stuck and if I cannot find the information online then I ask Tycho for help, the reason being is that Tycho is the more reliable backend developer. 
And even then, I will try to find the answer myself. You will not see me being rude for no reason, I am only rude when I have to be rude, as I just do not like to talk somebody down. 

For knowledge, I constantly ask people if they need help or any tips.
