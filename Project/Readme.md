## Frontend

For my front end i am using Typescript Angular, the reason behind that is simple. Because I saw the positive representation and decided to look deeper into it. 
When i did that i saw all the oppertunities it would bring. Like Type casting and actual error messages. 
It is also just more fun to use then normal Javascript as it asks you to really think of how you structure things. Because if things are not clear what type it is it will complain.
And that is what i was looking for. Something that complains but helps me improve my coding abilities. 
That is why i use Typescript. Its Javascript but more in line with other languages.

The reason why I use Angular is partly because of Typescript. I was planning on using the Typescript version of React. 
But just as a joke I looked at the documentation of Angular. And i just kind of fell in love with it. As it adresses my big problem with React. 
How the folders are structured. A component in Angular has the css/scss, the html, and the typescript file in one folder, while in other frameworks that would be bad practice and they would be in atleast 3 other folders.
I just like the structure more of Angular then other frameworks.

## Backend 

For the Backend i am using Java SpringBoot. The reason for it is because i failed my last semester 3 and so i decided to use Java SpringBoot again as i did not do justice to it last time. 
The reason why i said i did not do it justice is because i can see that Java is a beautiful language. But that i just buthered it last time. 
As i was way to focused on a sinking ship called my frontend.
